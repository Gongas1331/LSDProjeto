Portuguese hyphenation table (with accented vowels and cedillas), plus a package to help typeset
documents in Portuguese (LaTeX 2e). Uses the isolatin1 encoding, and the DC fonts. To install the
package it is necessary to

* Put the pthyph-t1.tex file where the program initex can find it; the directory where pt8hyph.tex
  is located is a very good choice (this is /usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/hyphen in recent GNU/Linux
  distributions).
* If desired, change all ocurrences of the pattern "ortuges" by "ortugues" in the names of files,
  and inside all files of the TeX distribution tree (this spelling mistake is unexcusable). Use
  the modify-teTeX bash shell script to do this automatically. (Use at your own risk.)
* Edit the language.dat configuration file, changing the text "pt8hyph.tex" by the text
  "pthyph-t1.tex". If this is done from within the program texconfig (see below), the format
  files will be redone automatically.
* Make new format files for TeX, LaTeX, etc. If you use the teTeX distribution, this can be done
  easily with the program texconfig (make sure you use a terminal window with MORE than 80
  columns). Otherwise you may need to run by hand the program initex.
* On recent tetex distributions use the texconfig-sys to change the GLOBAL default configuration

That's all!
