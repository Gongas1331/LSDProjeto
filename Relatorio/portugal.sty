% Used to typeset a document in portuguese. Words with accents are also
% hyphenated. Use _ instead of - to put an hyphen in a word (dir_te_ei
% instead of dir-te-ei). The underscore retains its normal operation in
% math mode. Unfortunately, this facility forbids the use of underscores
% in labels.
%
% Please report any problems to <tos@ua.pt>.
%
% Assumes that the pthyph-t1.tex portuguese hyphenation table was
% incorporated in the LaTeX2e format file.
